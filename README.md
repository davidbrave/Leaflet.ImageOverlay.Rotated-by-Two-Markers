# Leaflet.ImageOverlay.Rotated-by-Two-Markers
I modified the image overlay plugin for better usage, the original plugin is this link:
https://github.com/IvanSanchez/Leaflet.ImageOverlay.Rotated

# Usage
Just check the codes and know how :
index.html
utils.js
Leaflet.ImageOverlay.Rotated.js

# Demo show

### Using the code in other projects

The classic way: copy the `Leaflet.ImageOverlay.Rotate.js` file and include it
in your webpage.

`npm install leaflet-imageoverlay-rotated` can be used to include this project
as a dependency. The `package.json` file will allow webpack/browserify to work
its magic.

There is also some support for Bower (in the form of a `bower.json` file), but
Bower is being deprecated, so NPM is preferred.

This plugin has been tested only with Leaflet 1.0.0-beta and 1.0.0-rc1. Don't
expect it to work with 0.7.x.


### Legalese

The code for this plugin is under a Beerware license:
